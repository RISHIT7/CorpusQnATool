 1 This Conference places on record its deep grief and concern at the fast which Mahatma Gandhi has undertaken. The Conference is emphatically of opinion that the utmost freedom of conscience and religion is essential, and condemns any desecration of places of worship, to whatsoever faith they may belong, and any persecution or punishment of any person for adopting or reverting to any faith; and further condemns any attempts by compulsion to convert people to ones faith or to secure or enforce ones own religious observation at the cost of the rights of others. The members of the Conference assure Mahatma Gandhi and pledge themselves to use their utmost endeavours to enforce these principles and to condemn any deviation from them even under provocation. This Conference further authorizes the President to convey personally to Mahatma Gandhi the solemn assurance of this Conference to the above effect as also the united wishes of this Conference that Mahatma Gandhi should immediately break his fast in order to permit the Conference to have the benefit of his co operation, advice and guidance in deciding upon the speediest means of effectively checking the evil which is fast over spreading the country.
